# Reddit_API

Just a simple app to scrape data from the famous subreddit **Walltsreetbets** and some crypto related subreddits.

## How to use it?

**1.-** Create an **.env** file in the main folder and type in the following variables:

```
USER_AGENT = ''
CLIENT_ID = ''
CLIENT_SECRET = ''

APP_ID = ''
APP_SECRET = ''

If new to reddit, you will need to register and create an app in order to get this info.
